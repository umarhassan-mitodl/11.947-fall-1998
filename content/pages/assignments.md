This seminar is intended to complement the investigations of the Colloquium. Participants will read the draft Colloquium papers and other background material in advance of the presentations. Following each of the presentations, they will prepare a one or two page critique/reflection/commentary to be used as the starting point for our seminar discussions (3 copies of these should be handed in on the day of that discussion). Out of 12 possible commentary papers, students are expected to complete 10. One of these short critiques will then be developed into a final paper of 5-10 pages, intended to help the Colloquium presenter revise his or her draft paper. This is intended to be a thoughtful critique of the topic, as well as a commentary on the paper itself, so it should involve reading and incorporating some additional material on the subject.
